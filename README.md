-Problem
    -The company fails to understand the market demand and produces products in an excessive amount, resulting in an overstock issue.
    -This happens because product development team develops products without referring to any historical sales data, and often much of such products tend to remain unsold.
- Solution
    -Using historical sales data, recommend what type of products should be developed and how many should be manufactured so that the sales profit will be maximized. 
- Goal
    -product development team produces products which match with the market demands and doesnâ€™t make any overstock.
