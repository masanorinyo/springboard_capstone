    -In order to make sure non-defective product is available when needed, categorize each product into three types: 
      -A - most important product types. It will require more attentions for QA. Make sure the company can re-order for manufacturing of products whenever.
      -B - second important. Constantly check whether this category should be transitioned to A or C type.
      -C - least important.  re-order for manufacturing of this kind only when product in this category is sold out
